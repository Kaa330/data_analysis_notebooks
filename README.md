Data Analysis Notebooks

This repository contains lab assignments for the Introduction to Data Analysis course, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of data analysis, such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and the application of basic machine learning algorithms.

The necessary data files are located in the `datasets` folder. The following files are required for each notebook:

1. `preliminary_data_analysis.ipynb` — uses `4liver.csv`
2. `analysis_of_relationships_between_features_in_two_dimensional_dataset.ipynb` — uses `24liver.csv`
3. `data_clustering.ipynb` — uses `4heart2.csv`
4. `application_of_classification_methods.ipynb` — uses `4heart2.csv`
5. `conducting_ab_testing.ipynb` — uses `orders.csv` and `logs_exp.csv`
